# MyReads Project

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want
to read. React is used to build the application, with book data being retrieved from an API provided by Udacity.

## Installation

Setting up the application is done using either yarn or npm in the usual way, this will pull in all dependencies that
have been added to the `package.json` file that is included in the project.

In a terminal execute:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Running

The package `react-scripts` that is added in the previous installation step is used to launch a development version of
the application.

Once again, in a terminal execute:

```sh
yarn start
```

This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a new tab within a web browser, if it does not just
click the link at the beginning of this.

the Udacity React nanodegree repository. The original documentation for the starter code can be read
